This notebook is my submission for the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The goal is to predict house prices using the provided dataset, which includes features like square footage, neighborhood, and overall quality. I used XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, to achieve an RMSLE of 0.12946 on the test set, with preprocessing, feature engineering, and cross-validation to improve performance.
